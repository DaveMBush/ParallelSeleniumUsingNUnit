This project is a demo for the article I wrote
about [how to run Selenium test on multiple browsers 
at the same time]([http://blog.dmbcllc.com/running-selenium-in-parallel-with-any-net-unit-testing-tool/) (in Parallel).

It worked at the time I wrote it (about a year ago).

This code already assumes you know how to [setup a 
selenium grid](http://blog.dmbcllc.com/selenium-grid-setup/).  If you need help with that, I wrote
an article about that as well.

I've included files to start the selenium grid hub and
the nodes for the browsers, but you'll need to tweak
them for the particular jar file you are using.
